# MoodLens

## Introduction

IoT-enabled wristwatches worn by students monitor physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, skin temperature, and movement patterns) to detect emotional states. Data is integrated with an AR-based classroom heatmap, providing teachers with anonymized, real-time insights into student well-being and engagement.

## Features
- **IoT-Driven Monitoring**: Tracks physiological signals such as heart rate, skin temperature, and movement patterns.
- **AR Heatmaps**: Visualizes classroom emotional states in real-time for teachers.
- **Anonymized Insights**: Ensures student privacy while providing actionable data.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Cloud-based backend for seamless data processing and analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive dashboard for intuitive engagement.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: IoT wristwatches capture physiological signals from students.
2. **Data Processing**: The data is transmitted to the cloud using MQTT and processed in real time.
3. **Visualization**: An AR heatmap is generated, displaying emotional states in an intuitive format for teachers.
4. **Insights & Actions**: Teachers receive actionable insights to address stress, disengagement, or anxiety.
